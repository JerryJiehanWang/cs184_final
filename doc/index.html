  <h1 align="middle">CS 184 Final Project Proposal: Volumetric Scattering Rendering</h1>
<h2 align="middle">Team Member: Jiehan Wang</h2>

<h2 align="middle">Abstract</h2>
<p>Our project will implement Volumetric Path Tracing. Currently, in project 3, we implement a path tracer which only
support lights falling on explicit surface. However, in the real world, lights don't only interact with explicit surface.
Our current path tracer assumes that lights travel in vacuum, but in real path tracer scene, light actually travels through
  certain media, such as air. Lights will interact with many particles in the media, resulting in some kind of scattering
  effect. Volumetric rendering enables us to simulate some real world effects when lights interact with media, such as fog,
smoke and cloud, and it is important when we try to reach fidelity while doing path tracing. It is more challenging
than the normal path tracer, because unlike explicit, media are implicit to interact with, and scattering involves many
different lights behavior.</p>

  <h2 align="middle">Goals and Deliverable</h2>
  <h3>Plan to deliver: </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Homogeneous media scene with point light source.</li>
  <li>Homogeneous media scene with normal light source.</li>
  <li>Homogeneous media scene with different media (eg. fog, smoke).</li>
</ul>
  <h3>Hope to deliver: </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Bi-direction path tracing for volumetric scattering.</li>
    <li>Non-homogeneous media.</li>
    <li>Spectral Ray Tracing for media like water droplets in the air (rainbow!)</li>
  </ul>

<h2 align="middle">Schedule</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1. First week, modify the existing daes file or finding new dae files to support volumetric lighting for rendering.
  Getting familiar with project 3's path tracer's structure.</li>
  <li>2. Second week, implementing direct point lighting for isotropic absorbance and out-scattering when light travels
    through the media.
  </li>
  <li>3. Third week, implement global illumination, in-scattering and anisotropic scattering.</li>
  <li>3. Forth week, experiment with parameters of different media, exploring more advanced volumetric lighting rendering,
  such as bi-direction path tracer, non-homogeneous scattering.</li>
</ul>
